## [15:26] Vercel Deployment Status Check

Created a comprehensive Vercel deployment status monitoring script for GlassWall:

- Automated Vercel API authentication using the API key from gateway.env
- Correctly identified the GlassWall project on Vercel is named "glasswall-simple-app"
- All current deployments are healthy with status "READY"
- Latest deployment: dpl_6B7x5afivig9qe51Yih7hP7QbD79 (created 2026-02-10 15:07:01)
- Deployed URL: https://glasswall-simple-7xkb881yt-karsts-projects-b9f542bb.vercel.app
- Created reusable script at `/Users/karst/.openclaw/workspace/check_vercel_deployment_heartbeat.py` that:
  - Retrieves latest deployments
  - Checks for failing deployments
  - Saves status to memory/vercel_deployment_status.json
  - Updates heartbeat state automatically

This implementation is now integrated with the heartbeat system for continuous monitoring.

Note: There was a previous deployment issue mentioned in api-health-report.json for "glasswall-rebuild" with conflicting app and page files: "pages/dashboard.tsx" - "app/dashboard/page.tsx". This appears to be a separate project from the current "glasswall-simple-app" that's being monitored.
