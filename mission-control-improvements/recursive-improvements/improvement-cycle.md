# Mission Control Recursive Improvement Framework

## Improvement Cycle Process

1. **Research Phase** (30 minutes)
   - Analyze current Mission Control structure and identify enhancement opportunities
   - Research best practices for dashboard UX/UI
   - Explore similar systems for inspiration
   - Document findings and prioritize improvements

2. **Implementation Phase** (45 minutes)
   - Select highest priority improvements
   - Implement changes to code, UI, or functionality
   - Test implementations locally
   - Document changes made

3. **Evaluation Phase** (15 minutes)
   - Assess improvements objectively
   - Identify any issues or unexpected side effects
   - Document lessons learned
   - Generate new improvement ideas based on implementation

4. **Planning Phase** (15 minutes)
   - Plan next improvement cycle
   - Reprioritize backlog based on latest findings
   - Schedule next cycle
   - Update Kanban board

5. **Repeat cycle** for minimum 2 hours total
