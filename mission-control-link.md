# Mission Control UI

Your improved Mission Control UI is now running. You can access it at:

http://localhost:3002

The UI now features:
- Improved visual design with better contrast and readability
- Enhanced empty states with clear calls to action
- Better visual hierarchy and organization
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Improved accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus states)
- Dark mode support
- Consistent styling across all components
- **Task Creation and Management**: You can now create tasks and assign them to Pip

To start the Mission Control UI, run:
```bash
/Users/karst/.openclaw/workspace/check_mission_control.sh
```

To stop the development server when you're done, run:
```bash
cd /Users/karst/.openclaw/workforce/mission-control && pkill -f "next dev"
pkill -f "convex dev"
```

Feel free to explore the new interface and let me know if you'd like any additional changes or improvements!
