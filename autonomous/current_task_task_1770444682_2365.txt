AUTONOMOUS DASHBOARD TASK: Build Responsive Layout System

Create a comprehensive responsive layout system that adapts seamlessly to all device sizes from mobile to large desktop displays. Implement a fluid grid system, responsive typography, and adaptive component layouts. Ensure proper breakpoints, content prioritization on smaller screens, and touch-friendly interactions. Test thoroughly across device sizes and orientations. Make sure all interactive elements have appropriate hit areas for touch devices. The dashboard should feel native and optimized regardless of screen size or input method. Read /Users/karst/.openclaw/workspace/autonomous/quality_instructions.json for detailed requirements.
