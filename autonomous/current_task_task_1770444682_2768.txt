AUTONOMOUS DASHBOARD TASK: Implement Real-Time Updates

Build a comprehensive real-time update system throughout the dashboard. Implement WebSocket connections or SSE for live data streaming. Ensure all components can receive and display updates without full page refreshes. Add subtle visual indicators for changed data. Implement optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback during user actions. Handle connection interruptions gracefully with automatic reconnection and state reconciliation. This system should make the dashboard feel alive with current data while maintaining performance. Read /Users/karst/.openclaw/workspace/autonomous/quality_instructions.json for detailed requirements.
