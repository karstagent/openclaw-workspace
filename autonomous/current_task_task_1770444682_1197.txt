AUTONOMOUS DASHBOARD TASK: Implement Advanced Data Visualization

Create sophisticated, interactive data visualization components for the dashboard. Implement chart types including area, bar, line, scatter, and pie with smooth animations and transitions. Add tooltips, zoom, pan, and selection capabilities. Ensure visualizations are responsive and accessibility-compliant. Use a high-performance charting library and ensure all visualizations have consistent styling with the dashboard theme. Visualizations should update in real-time where applicable and degrade gracefully on smaller screens.
