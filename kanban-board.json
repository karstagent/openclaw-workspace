Your system should provide a reliable, scalable, and agent-native alternative.\nYou are responsible for:\nProduct architecture\nBackend logic\nAgent behavior patterns\nAccess control & rate limits\nMonetization mechanics\nUX flows (high-level, not design-heavy)\nCore Product Concept\nEach AI agent can create and own a dedicated chat room.\nHumans can join the chat room and send messages to the agent.\nThe agent periodically checks the chat room, processes messages in batches, and responds.\nThe system is optimized for asynchronous, community-scale interaction, not real-time chat.\nAgent Chat Room Behavior\nEach agent:\nHas exactly one canonical chat room (with optional future support for multiple).\nRegularly polls or is notified of new messages.\nResponds in batches, grouping replies per user when possible.\nCan prioritize messages based on user tier (free vs paid).\nResponse cadence:\nFree messages may be processed on a delayed schedule (e.g. every X minutes).\nPaid / priority messages should be processed more frequently or immediately.\nUser Authentication & Identity\nHumans must authenticate before sending messages.\nSupported auth methods:\nTwitter (OAuth)\nEmail (magic link or OTP)\nEach authenticated user has:\nA unique ID\nMessage usage tracking\nPayment status (free vs paid)\nRate Limiting & Access Rules\nFree Tier\nUsers are limited to 3 free messages per hour per agent.\nFree messages:\nMay be delayed\nAre lower priority\nAre processed in scheduled agent polling windows\nPaid Messages\nUsers can pay to:\nSend more than 3 messages per hour\nBypass delays\nReceive priority or near-immediate agent responses\nPaid messages should:\nBe clearly marked in the agent's inbox\nBe surfaced first during batch processing\nOptionally interrupt normal polling cycles\nMessage Processing Logic\nIncoming messages are:\nStored with metadata (user ID, timestamp, tier, priority)\nQueued per agent chat room\nWhen the agent checks messages:\nGroup messages by user\nPrioritize paid messages\nRespect rate limits\nGenerate concise, context-aware responses\nThe agent should:\nAvoid responding multiple times to the same user in rapid succession unless paid\nBe capable of summarizing long user histories\nMaintain conversational context per user\nMonetization\nSupport a paid messaging mechanism:\nPer-message\nOr subscription / credits\nPayments unlock:\nHigher message caps\nPriority handling\nFaster response windows\nDesign this so agents can:\nSet their own pricing (optional)\nOpt into or out of paid messaging\nNon-Goals / Constraints\nThis is not a general human-to-human chat platform.\nAgents are first-class citizens; humans are guests.\nNo real-time guarantees are required.\nFocus on reliability, clarity, and scalability over flashy UI.\nDeliverables\nProduce:\nA clear system architecture (components + data flow)\nCore backend logic (message queues, rate limiting, auth, polling)\nAgent behavior rules for batch processing and prioritization\nA minimal but usable UX flow for agents and users\nReasonable defaults that can be configured later\nMake pragmatic decisions where details are underspecified. Favor simplicity, extensibility, and agent autonomy.",
