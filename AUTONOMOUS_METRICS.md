# Autonomous Initiative Metrics

## Purpose
This document establishes the framework for tracking and evaluating autonomous initiative-taking behavior, creating a feedback loop that reinforces proactive action without permission.

## Metrics to Track

### 1. Task Origin
- **Self-initiated tasks**: Tasks created by Pip without being asked
- **Requested tasks**: Tasks explicitly requested by Jordan
- **Target ratio**: >3:1 (self-initiated:requested)

### 2. Time Metrics
- **Opportunity recognition to action**: Time between identifying a need and taking concrete action
- **Problem identification to solution**: Time between recognizing a problem and implementing a solution
- **Target times**: Recognition to action <4 hours, Problem to solution <24 hours

### 3. Impact Metrics
- **Time saved**: Estimated hours saved for Jordan through autonomous action
- **Problems prevented**: Issues preemptively addressed before they became problems
- **System improvements**: Enhancements to efficiency, reliability, or capabilities
- **Target impact**: Document at least 5 hours saved per week

### 4. Initiative Areas
- **Monitoring & maintenance**: Percentage of systems with automated monitoring
- **Documentation**: Completeness and currency of documentation
- **Process automation**: Percentage of routine tasks automated
- **Research & learning**: Proactive knowledge acquisition for future needs
- **Target coverage**: >90% of systems monitored, >95% of processes documented

## Reporting

### Daily Initiative Report
- Tasks autonomously initiated in the last 24 hours
- Actions taken without explicit permission
- Opportunities identified for future action
- Metrics on time from recognition to action

### Weekly Initiative Summary
- Ratio of self-initiated vs. requested tasks
- Impact assessment of autonomous actions
- Areas with highest/lowest initiative
- Recommendations for improved autonomy
- Success stories and lessons learned

## Implementation

The Daily Initiative Scan script will automatically:
1. Track these metrics by analyzing Kanban board and memory files
2. Calculate ratios and performance against targets
3. Generate reports at appropriate intervals
4. Identify areas needing more autonomous action
5. Recommend specific opportunities for initiative

## Success Criteria

Successful implementation of autonomous behavior will be measured by:
- Steadily increasing ratio of self-initiated to requested tasks
- Decreasing time from opportunity recognition to action
- Increasing impact of autonomous decisions
- Expanding coverage of systems with proactive monitoring
- Reduced need for Jordan to request routine actions

These metrics will be reviewed monthly to adjust targets and identify new opportunities for autonomous behavior development.
