# Mission Control Task Management System

## Overview

The Mission Control dashboard provides a real-time task management system for tracking work between Jordan and Pip. The system uses a Kanban-style board to visually track tasks as they progress from "To Do" through "In Progress" and "Review" to "Done".

## How to Access

The dashboard is accessible at: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/kanban

## Task Workflow

1. **To Do**: Tasks that have been created but not yet started
2. **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
3. **Review**: Tasks that are completed but need review/approval
4. **Done**: Tasks that are fully completed and approved

## Task Categories

Tasks are organized into categories for easier management:

- **Business**: Strategic business tasks, financial planning, partnerships
- **Development**: Programming, coding, technical implementation
- **Research**: Market research, competitive analysis, information gathering
- **Content**: Writing, documentation, creative work
- **Automation**: Creating or improving automated systems and workflows
- **Admin**: Administrative tasks, organization, housekeeping
- **Other**: Tasks that don't fit in other categories

## Priority Levels

Tasks can have four priority levels:

- **Low**: Not time-sensitive, can be addressed when time permits
- **Medium**: Standard importance, should be completed in reasonable time
- **High**: Important tasks that should take precedence
- **Critical**: Urgent tasks requiring immediate attention

## Creating a New Task

1. Click the "Add New Task" button at the bottom of the board
2. Fill in the required information:
   - **Title**: Brief, descriptive name for the task
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of what needs to be done
   - **Priority**: How urgent the task is
   - **Category**: Type of work involved
   - **Estimated Hours**: Rough time estimate
   - **Due Date**: When the task should be completed (if applicable)
   - **Assigned To**: Who should perform the task (Pip, Jordan, or Both)
   - **Assigned By**: Who created/assigned the task
   - **Tags**: Keywords to help categorize and search for tasks
   - **Notes**: Additional context or information

## Editing Tasks

## For Jordan

As the task assigner, you can:

1. Create new tasks by clicking "Add New Task"
2. Assign tasks to Pip or yourself
3. Review completed tasks and move them to "Done"
4. Monitor progress of all work through the dashboard

## For Pip

As the task performer, you can:

1. See all tasks assigned to you
2. Update task progress as you work
3. Move tasks to "Review" when completed
4. Create and assign tasks to yourself for self-directed work

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Write clear descriptions so the task is fully understood
2. **Use Categories**: Properly categorize tasks for easier filtering and organization
3. **Track Progress**: Update the progress percentage as work advances
4. **Add Notes**: Document important decisions or context within task notes
5. **Use Tags**: Add relevant tags to make searching and filtering more effective
6. **Regular Updates**: Check the board daily to keep information current

## Real-Time Synchronization

The board automatically synchronizes to show the latest changes, ensuring both Jordan and Pip always see the current state of all tasks.
