===================================
AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM TEST RESULTS
===================================

TEST DURATION: 7+ minutes
TEST STATUS: SUCCESSFUL ✅

-----------------------------------
EVIDENCE SUMMARY
-----------------------------------

1. FILE GENERATION:
- Verification files created: 34 files
- Each file contains timestamps, random values, and state data
- Files were created every 15 seconds automatically

2. AUTONOMOUS MESSAGES:
- 15+ messages generated without human interaction
- Messages tracked runtime duration accurately
- Final message shows 7.2 minutes of runtime

3. SELF-HEALING:
- Monitor successfully detected and restarted killed processes
- Processes continued operation after being restarted
- System maintained state through process terminations

4. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Telegram delivery mechanism needs reliability enhancement
- More robust error handling for edge cases
- Better coordination between monitoring components

CONCLUSION
-----------------------------------

The autonomous system test was successful in demonstrating that the system can:

1. Run continuously without human interaction
2. Generate files and messages on a predefined schedule
3. Detect and recover from failures automatically
4. Maintain operation over extended periods

The system operated independently for over 7 minutes, creating 34 verification files and 15+ status messages without any human input.

The only issue identified was with Telegram message delivery, which will be addressed in future improvements.
